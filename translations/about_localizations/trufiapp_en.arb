In many cities there are no official maps, apps or timetables. We complete them, and sometimes even draw routes from scratch. Our apps help everyone find the best way to get from point A to point B within their cities. A well-designed transportation system contributes to greater sustainability, cleaner air and a better quality of life.\n\nWe love La Llajta and public transportation, that's why Trufi Association created this app to make it easy for {city} commuters and anyone else to get around {city}.\n\nPlease help us make {appName} better by volunteering with us. We need mappers, developers, planners, testers, and many other hands. Please contact our team via email feedback@trufi.app.\n",
